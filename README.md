# RIPEMD160-36Step
Semi-free-start collision attack on the first 36-step RIPEMD160

Due to the limitation of my PC, we can't give the implementation to solve such an equation as explained in Section 4. 
However, once the computer is good enough, it can be implemented easily. Here, we use a similar way introduced in [12] 
to solve it and the time complexity is 2^7.

To verify our theoretical result, we suggest you firstly input 1 as the command so that we can immediately observe the result.
Then, you can choose 2 to verify the complexity evaluation. This process costs some time.

To verify the instance we get, we suggest you firstly input 0 as the command.
